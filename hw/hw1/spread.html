            How does virus spread?
            <p>
            In today’s constantly connected world you can contract a computer virus in many ways, some more obvious than others. 
            Viruses can be spread through email and text message attachments, Internet file downloads, social media scam links, 
            and even your mobile devices and smartphones can become infected with mobile viruses through shady App downloads. 
            Viruses can hide disguised as attachments of socially shareable content such as funny images, greeting cards, or audio and video files.

            To avoid contact with a virus it’s important to exercise caution when surfing the web, downloading files, 
            and opening links or attachments. As a best practice, never download text or email attachments that you’re not expecting, 
            or files from websites you don’t trust.
