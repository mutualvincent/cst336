            How does virus attack?
            <p>
            Once a virus has successfully attached to a program, file, or document, the virus will lie dormant until circumstances cause the 
            computer or device to execute its code. In order for a virus to infect your computer, you have to run the infected program, 
            which in turn causes the virus code to be executed. This means that a virus can remain dormant on your computer, 
            without showing major sings or symptoms. However, once the virus infects your computer, the virus can infect other computers on the same network. 
            Stealing passwords or data, logging keystrokes, corrupting files, spamming your email contacts, and even taking over your 
            machine are just some of the devastating and irritating things a virus can do.
